# TrayUtils
## About
TrayUtils is a program, which aims to solve the problem of having too many little tray applications slowing down your computer. It is basically one application, which can load modules. These modules can do almost everything. The Application comes with a custom Gui, which can be evoked with an item in the system tray. The main method of interaction between the user and the modules, or the application, is by using native system keybindings. That means they are accessible no matter what the user is doing. Since the project is kind of open source, it is possible for users, to develop their own modules (coming soon).

## Why Java?
By looking at the selling points of this program, you might have asked yourself why I chose Java to develop it in. It is widely known, that Java isn't the most resource-efficient programming language out there. So why decided I to use Java? <br> Firstly, it's the programming language I am most familiar with. But More importantly, it is just very nice to develop an application that can just be run on a number of different operating systems. It is also pretty easy to develop an application, loading external code (like addons), in Java. Programming an Application in Java also doesn't mean, it cannot be programmed with maximal resource-efficiency in mind.
### Resource Usage
As of version 1.0, the application only uses under 50mb of Memory whilst the gui is not opened. (At least on my system running Windows 10 Pro)
